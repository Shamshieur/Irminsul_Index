# Irminsul Index 🌿📚

> An offshoot of the Irminsul Repository Roots, focused on the Petrified Tree Resonance Offering shifts.

Irminsul Index is a dedicated extension of the Irminsul Repository Roots, with a special focus on the Petrified Tree archives. This site was created to align with the ever-repeating rhythm of samsara (Server Reset), offering insights into the cyclical flow of Teyvat’s domain shifts—referred to as Petrified Tree Resonance.

## 🎯 What It Does

- Displays the schedule of domain shifts, synced with the rhythms of Teyvat (Server Reset)
- Serves as a personal tool for those who want to track and analyze the repetitive cycle of domain layouts.

## ⚙️ Why This Exists

The purpose of this site is to simplify the struggle of navigating Teyvat’s domain cycles. Just as you may find yourself wondering:

This tool helps bring the cycles into a manageable view, syncing with the natural flow of Teyvat's world.
